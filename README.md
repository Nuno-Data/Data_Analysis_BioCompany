# Data_Analysis_BioCompany

This project was proposed by a biotechnology company with the main aim of generating a dataset of improved strains. To achieve this, the project included the validation and cleaning of datasets using a variety of methods. A specific description of the datasets, sub-goals, and guidelines are available at "Data_Analysis_BioCompany/AMYRIS/docs/".

Key points of the project included:

Validation of rows and columns using various methods.
Printed explanations of validation failures, attempted salvages, and whether the attempt was successful or not.
Statistical summary for each plate with outputs in CSV and JSON formats.
A function to generate improved strains based on the parent and various variables such as which "robot" was used to measure it, how many strains to retrieve, and the threshold for improvement over the parent.
Use of the interquartile range to detect and remove outliers.
